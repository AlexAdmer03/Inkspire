# Inkspire

**INKSPIRE** is an AI-powered real-time image generator built using Blazor WebAssembly. It allows users to create unique images based on their input in real time, thanks to the integration with the **FLUX.1 [schnell]** model via the Hugging Face API. This tool aims to inspire creativity, offering an interactive and engaging platform for generating AI-assisted visuals effortlessly.

## Features
Real-Time Image Generation: Generates images dynamically as users provide input, creating a smooth and responsive creative experience.
AI Model Integration: Utilizes the FLUX.1 [schnell] model from Hugging Face for high-quality image outputs.
Blazor WebAssembly: Entirely web-based, delivering a seamless UI and UX without the need for native installations.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly
**Backend API**: FLUX.1 [schnell] model via Hugging Face
**Languages**: C#


## To run INKSPIRE locally:

## Clone the repository.
Configure your Hugging Face API key within the project.
Start the Blazor WebAssembly application

## Usage
Once running, INKSPIRE provides a user-friendly interface to input image prompts. The app communicates with the Hugging Face API, which processes the prompts through the FLUX.1 [schnell] model and returns generated images in real-time.

## Future Enhancements
- Customizable Image Filters: Adding options for users to apply artistic filters.
- Expanded Prompt Capabilities: Improved prompt options for more nuanced image generation.
- Download Functionality: Enable users to download generated images directly from the app.
